# Morphometric patterns of brain development in premature infants

Master-level project conducted at inDev Team, Inserm NeuroDiderot UMR1141 department. CEA Saclay, NeuroSpin center | Oct 2021- Jan 2022.

I used the repository https://github.com/ecr05/MSM_HOCR to implement the MSM and aMSM method and the dHCP (developing Human Connectome Project) template code : http://www.developingconnectome.org/project/. Some code for result quantification can also be found in the report in the attachments section.

You can find the report and defense of this project for further details.
